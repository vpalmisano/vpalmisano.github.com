## Education
* **January 2007 - April 2010**: Information Engineering Ph.D. at “Polytechnic University of Bari” with the thesis: “Control Algorithms for multimedia streaming”.
* **August September 2000 - June 2006**: Computer Science Engineering Master degree with honors at “Polytechnic University of Bari” with the thesis: “Control Algorithms for multimedia applications”.
* **September 1995 - July 2000**: High school degree at: “Liceo Scientifico L. da Vinci Noci” (BA), grade: 100/100.

## Work experience
* **August 2023 - now: Staff Video Developer at [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/)** - I've contributed to the design, development, monitoring and testing of the RingCentral Video and RingCentral Events (formerly Hopin) products, working on the WebRTC and on the video streaming tech stacks, improving the services in order to scale to thousands of concurrent users with hundred of published audio/video streams for each conference room. I had the opportunity to manage the technology stack in multiple aspects, from user interface to data transport, down to server infrastructure management, looking for solutions for optimal management of the platform. I've also contributed to the media encoding stack implementing optimizations to get perfect recordings of the video conferencing sessions and to distribute the streams using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol. I have deepened my knowledge regarding using AI technologies in the realtime and live streaming environments, in particular integrating audio-to-speech and speech-to-audio techniques with WebRTC and using video segmentation and recognition.
* **June 2021 - July 2023: Staff Developer at [Hopin](https://hopin.com)** - I've contributed to the design, development and testing of the real-time communication platform that powered the session.com and Hopin Events products. With my webrtcperf testing tool, we have been able to evaluate system performance with thousands of concurrent generated participants, helping find bottlenecks, CPU overloads, memory hogs and fixing bugs before they are introduced into production, ensuring a quality service comparable with the state of the art in videoconferencing systems.
