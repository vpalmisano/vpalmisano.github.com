A browser library used by the webrtcperf tool to capture the RTC logs and run page inspection/automation. It can also be used stand-alone importing the javascript package into the page before loading the other javascript sources. It contains some utilities to debug the page RTC connections, the getUserMedia and getDisplayMedia, evaluate the end-to-end delay, etc.
