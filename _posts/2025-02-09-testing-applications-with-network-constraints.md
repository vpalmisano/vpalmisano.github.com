Applications are increasingly dependent on reliable network performance to deliver a seamless user experience. However, networks are inherently unpredictable due to varying bandwidth, latency, packet loss, and connectivity interruptions. Testing applications under such constraints is crucial to ensure their robustness and usability in real-world scenarios. This article describes how to test applications in the Linux environment using the Throttler tool (https://github.com/vpalmisano/throttler) to apply network constraints.
