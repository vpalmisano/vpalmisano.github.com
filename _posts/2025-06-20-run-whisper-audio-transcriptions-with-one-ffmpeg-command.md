In an increasingly data-driven world, the ability to convert spoken words into written text has become invaluable. From facilitating accessibility for the hearing impaired and streamlining meeting minutes to enabling sophisticated content analysis and powering voice assistants, accurate audio transcriptions are the core of numerous modern applications. Traditionally, this process could be labor-intensive and often limited by the capabilities of available tools. However, the advent of advanced AI models has revolutionized the field.

This article explores the usage of Whisper.cpp (https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp), an high-performance automatic speech recognition library using the OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model (https://github.com/openai/whisper), integrated into the popular FFmpeg project, allowing you to write simple audio transcription pipelines with just one shell command.
